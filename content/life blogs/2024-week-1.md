It's been one week since we stepped into 2024. And I would like to present a brief summary of what it was like for me. 


I finished reading "Reflections on the Guillotine" by Albert Camus. I had recently finished watching a series which ended with a debate around the morality of the death penalty and I wanted to learn more. It was interesting to read Albert Camus's views which were ofcourse focused primarily on mid 20th century France. 
I am now further interested in reading about the state of death penalty laws in India and other countries. 

On a lighter, brighter note; I started the year with lots of flowers around me! I love giving myself, and receiving from others, a bright, fragrant bouquet of flowers. 
Below are some of the flowers from this week:

I memorized the lyrics of my university's anthem! It's written in Urdu. I must have heard (and half sung) it a hundred times at the university but I never really got to learning the lyrics (in the correct order!) until now. 
I missed my friend Ghazala a lot during this exercise. She was one of the first people I befriended at the university and many of my memories of being there are associated with her. We used to get very emotional and filled with feelings of loyalty and connection towards our university (and towards each other) when we sang the anthem. I am glad I finally memorized it!

I restarted coloring Mandala patterns today. I made a trip to Dussman with a friend yesterday and got myself some Mandala books and a colour pens set (Dussman is one of my most favourite places to be in Berlin). Coloring Mandalas helps me a lot to calm myself during moments of anxiety and panic. I will share photos when I finish coloring the first pattern. 

Oh, one more "artsy" thing I did during this week was to make potpourri out of the previous flowers I had received (or got for myself). I let the petals dry out on a tray and then sprinkled some rose oil on them and put them in a pretty jar. Here:

I was unwell during the first two days of the year, therefore I had a slow start. That made me feel very frustrated and then sad as I was very ambitious about this week, I wanted to make a "strong start" into the year (duh!). But I think I still managed to save the week by doing smaller tasks and enjoying myself doing art.
