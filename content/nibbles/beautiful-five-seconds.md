My father and I do not have a great relationship.  
The conlficts that severed our relationship are no longer fresh in our memories, but the effect lingers and will probably do forever.
I avoid looking him in the eyes and he avoids looking in mine. But we manage to exchange our _salams_ in the morning when he's leaving for work and in the evening when he returning from work. 

I realize as I am writing today that I have managed to silence the voice of my father in my head and have closed my eyes to his presence in my life. Living away from home had made this easier. 

One day he will be gone from this world. And I will regret not spending more time with him while I could. And I will regret not sitting with him for tea, even if we wouldn't talk. And I will regret not looking at his handsome face while there was still life in it.  
I am feeling overwhelmed and heavy in my heart now.  
Should I move now and sit in the next room where my dad is? I think I should. 
I am now sitting at a distance from my father, but in the same room as him.  
He looked at me, with a surprised look on his face, as I came into the room and sat on the other sofa. I think he is surprised because I never sit in this room where he spends most of his time when at home.   
I glace at his face as he watches TV. It is a handsome face.  

I look at my brother sitting next to my father. My brother has suffered. And when he did, I was incapable of helping him. And I still feel pain as I recall that I had, infact, added to his suffering.  
I wish we were friends now like we were when we were little. I hope he is happy.  

My mother is happy today. She sewed a _salwar kameez_ for herself on her own. It came out very neat, I would say. I am glad my mother has a hobby that makes her happy.  

My little brother is a happy young man. He has a decent friend circle too. I am proud of him for maintaining a emotionally healthy lifestyle (unlike the trend in our family) by having friends, hobbies, routines.  
Only he doesn't like to sit down and study.  

Oh, what I originally wanted to write about today was a little happy moment that I shared with my dad two days ago.  
Dad was standing nea the kitchen when I ran into him. I said, "hey, dad! whatsup?" without really looking him in the eyes and he smiled. That encouraged me, so I went closer and began tickling him gently. And he laughed. I laughed too. My sister who needed something from the kitchen saw us and shared in the laughter.   
And then I left.  
But I left with a light, happy feeling in my heart. For five secs, dad was the old him and I was the old me and we were a happy dad-daughter duo that we used to be several years ago. Those were some beautiful five secs.
