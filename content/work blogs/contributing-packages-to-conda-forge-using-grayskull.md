When contributing packages to conda-forge, Grayskull can make your life much easier.
Grayskull generates recipes for Python packages hosted on PyPI.
As the introduction for Grayskull reads; “The main goal of this project is to generate concise recipes for conda-forge.”

In this tutorial we learn how to contribute a Python package to the conda-forge channel using Grayskull to generate the recipe.

Let us get started.

1. Install `grayskull` using `conda` through the `conda-forge` channel:
`conda install -c conda-forge grayskull`  
2. Fork and clone the conda-forge [staged-recipes repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes) from GitHub.
3. Fetch a new branch from the `master` branch.  
4. Through CLI enter inside the ‘staged-recipes’ directory.  
5. Call `grayskull` and pass the `pypi` repository, followed by the name of the package you want to contribute to conda-forge. For example:
`grayskull pypi abc`  
Grayskull will create a folder with the same name as the package (in this case: ‘abc’) in the ‘recipes’ folder of the ‘staged-recipes’ directory.  
This folder will contain the `meta.yaml` file and also the license file if the package includes a license in the PyPI distribution.  
6. Go through the generated `meta.yaml` file.
For simpler packages, the generated recipes are nearly perfect, but for some packages you might need to make certain tweaks.  
7. Commit and push the changes.  
`git add.`  
`git commit -m “add a commit message”`  
`git push`  
8. Create a PR. Dropping a message in the conda-forge public [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#conda-forge_conda-forge.github.io:gitter.im) channel and a link to your PR might be a good idea to get your PR reviewed and merged.

Once the PR gets merged, your package will be available on the conda-forge channel.  
Tada! It’s that easy.
