      <description>My father and I do not have a great relationship.
The conlficts that severed our relationship are no longer fresh in our memories, but the effect lingers and will probably do forever. I avoid looking him in the eyes and he avoids looking in mine. But we manage to exchange our salams in the morning when he&amp;rsquo;s leaving for work and in the evening when he returning from work.
I realize as I am writing today that I have managed to silence the voice of my father in my head and have closed my eyes to his presence in my life.</description>

      <description>We had only been friends for a few weeks when A.H. proposed we take a stroll in the Tiergarten.
It was a bright but very cold morning, there was a promise of snow. The garden was mostly yellow and dry this time of the year. But it was still a desirable change from Central Berlin streets which were very pretty, but weren&amp;rsquo;t especially green.
We agreed the garden would be lush during the summer months and promised to visit again in summer.</description>

      <title>An Accidental Emending</title>

      <description>Since coming back from my week long stay at grandmotherâ€™s village, my total mess of a sleep schedule has miraculously fixed itself. Perhaps this self emending is not too miraculous after all.
In the village I would sleep on a charpayi on the roof with my grandmother, aunt, uncle and his children. Of course electricity is still erratic in that North Indian village, people call it bed time when the sky turns dark and wakey-wakey when the dawn breaks.</description>
