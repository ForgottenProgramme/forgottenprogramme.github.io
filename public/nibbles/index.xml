      <description>My father and I do not have a great relationship.
The conlficts that severed our relationship are no longer fresh in our memories, but the effect lingers and will probably do forever. I avoid looking him in the eyes and he avoids looking in mine. But we manage to exchange our salams in the morning when he&amp;rsquo;s leaving for work and in the evening when he returning from work.
I realize as I am writing today that I have managed to silence the voice of my father in my head and have closed my eyes to his presence in my life.</description>
