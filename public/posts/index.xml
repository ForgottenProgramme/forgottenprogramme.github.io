      <description>We had only been friends for a few weeks when A.H. proposed we take a stroll in the Tiergarten.
It was a bright but very cold morning, there was a promise of snow. The garden was mostly yellow and dry this time of the year. But it was still a desirable change from Central Berlin streets which were very pretty, but weren&amp;rsquo;t especially green.
We agreed the garden would be lush during the summer months and promised to visit again in summer.</description>
