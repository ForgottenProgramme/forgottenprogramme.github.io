      <description>I have been delaying writing this Outreachy blog for over two weeks now. Aagghh! I kept thinking I’ll write it up when I have the perfect struggle story to share, when I am in the perfect mood to write. But that doesn’t happen. Waiting for ‘the inspiration’ to write is the best way to make sure that you never write at all.
Better done than perfect!
The theme for this blog (as suggested by the Outreachy folks) is ‘an open source vocabulary term’ that I once didn’t know and eventually learnt.</description>

      <description>When contributing packages to conda-forge, Grayskull can make your life much easier. Grayskull generates recipes for Python packages hosted on PyPI. As the introduction for Grayskull reads; “The main goal of this project is to generate concise recipes for conda-forge.”
In this tutorial we learn how to contribute a Python package to the conda-forge channel using Grayskull to generate the recipe.
Let us get started.
Install grayskull using conda through the conda-forge channel: conda install -c conda-forge grayskull Fork and clone the conda-forge staged-recipes repository from GitHub.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog I wrote about the Outreachy application process and my experience during the contribution period.
A lot has happened since then. For one; I got selected. (Yippie!)
And second; the internship has already begun. Week one completed today.
Outreachy encourages its interns to write a blog every two weeks. I plan on to write one every week. This week’s blog is going to be about me, my core values and my motivation behind applying at Outreachy.</description>

      <title>My Outreachy Application</title>

      <description>Last year my initial application at Outreachy was rejected because I had submitted it on the last day.
I had invested quite some time in my initial application and felt a bit dejected that the folks at Outreachy hadn’t even reviewed my application.
That year, reported Outreachy, there was an “overwhelmingly large” number of applications and Outreachy decided not to review those submitted on the day of the deadline.
This year, I decided I was going to be vigilant and proactive.</description>
